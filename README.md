Title: My JavaScript Calculator Project

Introduction:
I recently developed a JavaScript calculator project aimed at providing users with a simple yet functional tool for basic arithmetic operations.

Features:
The calculator supports all standard arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It also includes advanced functions such as square root and exponentiation. Users can input complex expressions with parentheses for precedence, and the calculator evaluates them accurately.

User Interface:
The calculator features a clean and intuitive user interface with buttons for numbers and operations. The display area shows both the input expression and the result, providing users with real-time feedback as they input their calculations.

Technologies Used:
The calculator is built using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality.

Development Process:
During development, I followed an Agile approach, regularly iterating on the design and functionality based on user feedback. One of the main challenges I faced was handling complex expressions with parentheses, but I overcame this by implementing a recursive parsing algorithm.

Future Enhancements:
In the future, I plan to add support for additional scientific functions such as trigonometric operations and logarithms. I also aim to improve the user interface by adding themes and customizable settings to enhance the user experience further.

Conclusion:
Overall, the JavaScript calculator project was an exciting endeavor that allowed me to hone my skills in web development while creating a practical tool for users. I learned valuable lessons about parsing algorithms and user interface design, and I look forward to implementing further enhancements in future iterations of the project.
